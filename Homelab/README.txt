Pizza Company Server Infrastructure!

**Project Overview:**
This project aimed to create a server network for Luigi's Pizza Paradise's website development and other infrastructure needs.

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand the difference between Virtual Machines and Docker.
- Learn about DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
- Gain experience in installing and accessing a server, using SSH (Secure Shell).
- Install and utilize a Docker management tool (Portainer).
- Host a website using Nginx.

**Key Concepts:**
- Virtual Machine: A virtualized emulation of a physical computer, capable of running its own operating system and applications.
- Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization.
- DNS (Domain Name System): Converts domain names into IP addresses, facilitating communication over the internet.
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
- SSH (Secure Shell): A cryptographic network protocol for securely accessing a remote computer's command-line interface.
- Portainer: A lightweight management UI for Docker environments.
- Nginx: A high-performance web server and reverse proxy.

**Activities:**

1. **Virtual Machine vs. Docker:**
   - *Story:* Luigi's team needs to decide between using virtual machines or Docker for their server infrastructure.
   - *Task:* Explain the differences between virtual machines and Docker containers, including resource utilization, scalability, and isolation. In what Situations is a Docker or Virtual maschine more efficient.
   - *Bonus:* Explain what a Hypervisor is? what do Docker have in comparison?

2. **DNS and DHCP:**
   - *Story:* When you setup the Server you think about allocating the DNS and DHCP to a VM in your Server.
   - *Task:* Define DNS and DHCP, explain their roles in network configuration. What use would it have to have DHCP/DNS Server? What do you use at Home for that Job since you never installed a DHCP and DNS Server at home.

3. **Server Installation and SSH Access:**
   - *Story:* You are in Home Office and need to access the Server you can use SSH to do so.
   - *Task:* Provide simple explaination what SSH is. Access your server via SSH.

4. **Docker Management with Portainer:**
   - *Story:* Managing Docker containers efficiently is crucial for Luigi's server infrastructure.
   - *Task:* Install Portainer and setup a Minecraft Server using their Documentation and/or Youtube.

5. **Hosting a Website with Nginx:**
   - *Story:* Luigi's website needs a reliable local hosting solution. Buying a hosting service is to expensive.
   - *Task:* Install and configure a Nginx Docker as a web server to host Luigi's Pizza Paradise website, including setting up virtual hosts and SSL encryption.

**Conclusion:**

Congratulations on successfully completing the Project: Pizza Company Server Infrastructure! By mastering essential server concepts and tools like virtualization, DNS, DHCP, SSH, Docker, Portainer, and Nginx, Luigi's Pizza Paradise is well-equipped to meet its technological needs. With a robust server network in place, Luigi's can ensure a seamless online presence and provide excellent service to its customers. Cheers to a successful implementation and continued success in the pizza business! üçïüöÄ
