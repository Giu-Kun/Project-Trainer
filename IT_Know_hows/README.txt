Project: Pizza Company infrastructure

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to create informational documents for a pizza company's website development. The documents will serve as a platform for their new infrastructure, incorporating essential IT knowledge.

**Learning Goals:**
- Gain a solid foundation in essential IT knowledge, including:
   - The OSI Layer
   - Switches/Hubs
   - Routers/Modems
   - VLAN
   - Access Points

- Bonus: Understand IoT Devices

**Key Concepts:**

1. **The OSI Layer:** The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model defines how data is transmitted over a network, comprising seven layers, each serving a specific function.

2. **Switches/Hubs:** These devices connect multiple devices within a local area network (LAN), with switches being more efficient in data transmission compared to hubs.

3. **Routers/Modems:** Routers determine the best path for data packets to travel between networks, while modems modulate digital signals for communication over physical mediums like DSL or cable.

4. **Access Points:** These devices bridge wired and wireless networks, enabling seamless connectivity for devices like smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices.

5. **VLANs** These virtually Split Networks securely.

6. **Bonus - IoT Devices:** Internet of Things devices are everyday objects embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity to exchange data over the internet.


**Activities:**

Imagine the bustling operations of a popular pizza place, let's call it "Luigi's Pizza Paradise." Luigi's has been serving delicious pizzas to its loyal customers for years, but as technology evolves, so do their needs. Here's a glimpse into how each IT concept could play a crucial role in improving Luigi's business:

1. **The OSI Layer:**
   *Story:* Luigi's team optimize their network infrastructure, ensuring smooth communication and data exchange between Customer and there new Order Website.
   *Task:*  Create a Diagram with examples how the infrastructure would look (Use the OSI Layer as a Template).
   *Bonus:* What is TCP/IP?

2. **Switch/Hub:**
   *Story:* During peak hours, Luigi's Pizza Paradise experiences a surge in online orders and inquiries. With traditional hubs, data collisions and bottlenecks often occur, leading to delays in order processing and customer dissatisfaction. By upgrading to switches, Luigi's can segment its network, directing data packets more efficiently and minimizing congestion.
   *Task:* Write a Document that explains what switches are and why they would be better in the envoirment. Make sure to explain the key differences between Switches and Hubs. Why do Hubs not get used anymore? What are Advantages and Disadvantages for using those.

   *Bonus: * The Rival Company "Mario's Lazagna Palacae" for some reason can collect Data over your Customers since Garfield (his Manager) comes visiting regurally.
   *Task:*   Write a concept how can you make sure Garfield can't at some Point read the secret Tomatoesauce recepie. And how you could possibly prevent this without changing the phisical infrastructure.

3. **Router/Modem:**
   *Story:* For the furture Orders should be made using the Order App. Sadly there is only WiFi for employees and company Devices. Now they need to add a whole new Network for Customers.
   *Task:* Explain what is needed for a working wifi network. What is a Router for? What is a Modem? Where are they placed in the OSI?

   *Story:* Someone noticed that when you check the IP it is a different depending if you look in the browser (What is my IP?) or do an "ip adress" in the terminal.
   *Bonus:* Difference between Public and private IP adress and what has this to do with this topic?

4. **VLAN**
   *Story:* One Colleague made you aware of the fact that you could just setup a VLAN. You have never heard about that before. Maybe it is cheaper to use existing infrastructure.Garfield tries to abuse the new Wlan but couldnt says the Colleague why?
   *Task:* Is it logical and secure to use a new VLAN instead? Can all devices support VLANs? What is a Layer 3 Switch? Why cant Garfield access the server from the new Vlan although it all uses the same router?
   *Bonus:* What is WAN/SAN/LAN/WLAN where is the difference?
   *Task:* What do they stand for? Write an example for each. Are there more?


5. **Access Points:**
   *Story:* You have in some areas no good connection. So you wanna buy AP.
   *Task:* What are those and what is a repeater (for Ethernet cable) is an AP similar?

6. **Bonus - IoT Devices:**
   *Story:* Luigi's Pizza Paradise is exploring ways to improve kitchen efficiency and food quality. By incorporating IoT devices such as smart ovens, temperature sensors, and inventory trackers, they can monitor cooking processes, maintain optimal storage conditions, and ensure ingredients are always fresh. This not only enhances productivity but also elevates the overall dining experience for customers.
   *Task:* Write a Document that explains how IOT Devices work and how they could enhance productivity. What changes do you maybe need to do to the infrastructure? What risks could occur?

   
**Conclusion:**

Congratulations on successfully completing the Project: Pizza Company infrastructure! By incorporating essential IT knowledge and understanding key concepts such as the OSI layer, switches, routers, modems, access points, and IoT devices, you have laid a solid foundation for Luigi's Pizza Paradise to thrive in the digital age. With these informational documents in place, Luigi's can enhance its infrastructure, improve operational efficiency, and deliver exceptional service to its customers. Cheers to a successful launch and continued success in the pizza business! üçïüéâ
